Basic Chrome extension message passing between popup and service worker

### Summary


Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This Chrome browser extension example demonstrates simple message passing between two contexts: the **popup** context and the **service worker** context.

```
*********                ***********
*       * message------>>* service *
* popup *                * worker  *
*       * <<----response *         *
*********                ***********
sender                   receiver
```
